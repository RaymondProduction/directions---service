# Test project
I used Directions Service [![N|Solid](https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/product/1x/maps_32dp.png)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions?hl=en)

This small project has such opportunities

  - Draggable Directions
  - It can show geo coordinates of start and end points
  - It can show geo coordinates of direction points
  - Show polygon
